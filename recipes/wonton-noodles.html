                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>While you can use many types of noodles to make lucky noodles (also called longevity or long life noodles), Mama uses wonton noodles. They are thin egg-based noodles that are often eaten dry or in soups with proteins, greens, and wontons. You can find the staple in many restaurants and food stalls serving Cantonese-style Chinese cuisine, particularly in southern China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Singapore.</p>
                <p>My family enjoys the noodles with wontons, blanched bok choy or gai lan (Chinese broccoli), and a variety of proteins (pork, chicken, and duck). While Mama makes a big batch of barbecued char siu pork for Chinese New Year, she gets roasted ducks from a local restaurant and heads to Costco for rotisserie chickens and bags of Bibigo chicken and cabbage mini wontons.</p>
